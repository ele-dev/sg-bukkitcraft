# sg-bukkitcraft
Static HTML webpage for an old minecraft server project
It has very basic HTML & CSS files which are served using an Webserver.
The original purpose of the project was to provide info. advertisement, contact
about the minecraft server, the team behind it and the technical stuff behind the scenes.

It can be easily deployed with the docker file.
Just build an image and then run a docker container based on the image.
